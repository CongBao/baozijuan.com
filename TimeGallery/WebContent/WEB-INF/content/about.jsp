					<h1 id="about">About This Site</h1>
					<p>As you can see from the domain name, this site was designed
						for a very personal purpose, aiming to record the time we have
						spent and some interesting or impressive stories about us. Also,
						share them with our friends. The origin of building this website
						can be traced back to several months ago, when I said to her that
						I want to buy the domain of her name. Limited by the high price of
						renting a server and the knowledge of building a server on my own
						PC, the plan was not executed until June, when the birthday gift
						for her was completed and the final exam came to the end. Since
						the end of June was also the half-year anniversary of us, after
						learning some knowledges about network technology, the plan was
						now in process. Several kinds of elements would be added into web
						pages following her wishes, such as a tree for everyone to plant
						their dreams, and a time line to record sweet moments. However, I
						have to apologize here that since the whole site was developed and
						maintained by myself alone, the process would be quite slow. It
						would be kind if you can pay patience to me.</p>
