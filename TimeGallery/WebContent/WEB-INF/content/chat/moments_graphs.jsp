			The drawings recorded their daily lives from 27th September to 24
			December, 2016. Each picture describes an event happened on that day
			or something related. These drawings were published on his Weibo (<a
				href="http://www.weibo.com/u/6032184901" target="_blank">@DUADbao</a>)
			serially. If you are interested in what described in these drawings,
			and want to learn more about the stories, please subscribe his Weibo,
			where you can find everything you want. However, this Weibo will not
			update anymore.
		</p>
		<p>What's next is the stories depending on these drawings; not the
			original stories described in the picture but the brand new ones with
			our imagination. Yes, you didn't miss anything. We will start "our
			story" at the first day of 2017, and write a short story everyday
			depending on the drawings. The stories may upload to this site once a
			week. If you are interested in it, just focus on this site.</p>
